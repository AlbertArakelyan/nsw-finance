NSW stands for *Need*, *Saving*, *Wish*. This simple tool alows you to manage your needs, savings and wishes based on your monthly income. In addition it allows you to manage your whole yearly savings by separating your savings amount and expected spendings (and not only) and see automaticaly calculated available amount of savings.
